# JS Book Library
[JS Book Library](http://www.leosoaivan.com/js-book-library/) is a simple todo-list-like webapp that can be used to keep track of books that have been read. At present, it is not supported by a backend. As such, refreshing the page will cause the table to clear and populate with books hard-coded in the main JS file (i.e., a fine selection of J. R. R. Tolkien's works). It was styled with [Materialize CSS](https://materializecss.com/), and uses the modal componant to display a form to add books.

This was done as a small exercise on objects and object constructors for The Odin Project. You can see the project description and requirements [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/objects-and-object-constructors).
